# SmartPointers-Menu

Made by: Max Lucio Martins de Assis.

Generic menu made in C++ utilizing Smart Pointers, it's compatible with any C++ program and in it's pure version, can run in any Operational System.

Inspired by the Menu Model created by Dr. AndrÃ© F. de Angelis.

## Things to Know

You can include this menu in your program without any problems, since the Menu class is "dumb" and doesn't even know what options it has, this is defined by you when you edit the code in the process() method and that's why this works with any program and can be considered a Universal Menu for C++ on terminals.
